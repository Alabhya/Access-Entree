    - When I'm done talking, I'm going to do whatever is in my Post Dialogue Event.
    - By default, this will destroy me, but you can set this to anything you'd like.
    - Be creative! I can affect other objects as well.
    - Just make sure the proper dialogue is being checked AND that the dialogue's
